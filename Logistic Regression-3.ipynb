    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\n",

    "Definition:\r\n",

    "Q5. Explain how logistic regression can be used for multiclass classification.\n",
    "Ans:-Logistic regression is inherently a binary classification algorithm, meaning it is designed for problems with two classes (e.g., 0 and 1). However, there are techniques to extend logistic regression for multiclass classification problems, where there are more than two classes. Two common approaches for achieving multiclass classification using logistic regression are the One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) strategies.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. One-vs-Rest (OvR) Strategy:\r\n",
    "In the One-vs-Rest strategy, a separate binary logistic regression model is trained for each class, treating that class as the positive class and the rest as the negative class. For example, if there are three classes (A, B, C), three separate models are trained as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Model 1: Class A vs. Not Class A (B or C)\r\n",
    "Model 2: Class B vs. Not Class B (A or C)\r\n",
    "Model 3: Class C vs. Not Class C (A or B)\r\n",
    "During prediction, each model assigns a probability for the instance belonging to the positive class. The final class assignment is typically based on the model with the highest predicted prob\n",
    "Implementation in Code:\r\n",
